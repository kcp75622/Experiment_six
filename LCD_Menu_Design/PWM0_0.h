 * @note This driver assumes that the system clock's frequency is 50 MHz.
 *
 * @note This driver assumes that the PWM_Clock_Init function has been called
 * before calling the PWM0_0_Init function.

/**
 * @brief Initializes the PWM Module 0 Generator 0 with the specified period and duty cycle.
 *
 * This function initializes the PWM Module 0 Generator 0 with the given period constant and duty cycle.
 * It configures the PB6 pin to operate as a Module 0 PWM0 pin (M0PWM0) to output the PWM signal.
 * period_constant determines the PWM signal's frequency. The specified duty_cycle value must be less 
 * than the period_constant.
 *
 * @param period_constant The period constant for the PWM signal that determines the
 *                        PWM signal's frequency.
 *
 * @param duty_cycle The duty cycle, as a percentage of period_constant, for the PWM signal.
 *                   This value controls pulse width of the PWM signal.
